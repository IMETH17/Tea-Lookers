        Sri Lanka is an island made for tea. The country produces tea throughout
        the year and the total tea production is about 340 million kilograms per
        annum. Sri Lanka's tea-growing areas are mainly concentrated in the
        central highlands and southern inland areas of the island.

        Ceylon Tea's distinct flavor is also governed by it being exclusively
        handpicked mainly according to the two leaves and bud method, and almost
        93% of the Ceylon Tea produced annually is produced according to
        artisanal and orthodox methods compared to CTC method practiced
        worldwide.

            It was as far back as the year 1824 in which the British brought a
            tea plant from China to Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known at the time).
            It was planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya and is
            considered to have been the first non-commercial tea plant in Sri
            Lanka. After nearly two decades in 1867, James Taylor, Scottish by
            origin, planted 19 acres of tea in the city of Kandy in Ceylon, at
            the Loolecondra Estate as the first commercial tea plantation. The
            eventual sale of Loolecondra teas resulted in 1872, in Kandy and the
            first tea consignment to London in 1873. These pioneering efforts
            were done by trial and error and improved over the years via the
            introduction and improvement of tea processing machines and methods,
            by different individuals and companies. The first broking firm John
            Brothers & Co. was established in 1876 and the first public Colombo
            auction took place in 1883 under the guidance of the Ceylon Chamber
            of Commerce (which was established in 1839). The Colombo Tea
            Traders' Association was formed in 1894 and in 1925 the Tea Research
            Institute was established. These organizations helped boost the
            production and export of Ceylon Teas in its early stages
