          Not long after the British occupied the 'Teardrop Isle' in the early 19th century, they realised Sri Lanka's highlands were ideal for growing tea. Plantations were terraced into the mountainsides, factories and rudimentary accommodations built for pickers, and a rail network engineered to transport leaves down to Colombo. The stretch of line between Kandy and Ella is considered one of the most beautiful in the world.Tea remains a significant part of the Sri Lanka's economy - they call it 'green gold'. And over the last decade, it's become a significant feature on holiday itineraries. The most popular plantations to visit are those around Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Ella, where a cool, misty climate makes for excellent growing conditions.Sri Lanka is one of only a few countries where tea is still plucked by hand, from bushes planted along the contours of the slopes. A highly skilled workforce, predominantly Tamil women, moves along rows of bushes, stripping two leaves and a bud from each plant and often covering over 10km in a day. After picking, the leaves are immediately carried to the nearby factories where they are dried, processed and packed into crates ready for transportation.

                Dunkeld, situated on the banks of the Castlereagh reservoir is
                perhaps the most picturesque tea estate in Sri Lanka. The estate
                is between an elevation of 4000 and 5000 feet and the nearest town
                is Hatton, 20 km away. Colombo is a distance of 140km. Dunkeld
                comprises of 220 hectares or 550 acres of high grown Ceylon tea,
                annually producing about 350,000 kgs.

              The name Homadola estate was derived from HOMA DOLA (Brook). The
              Homadola - Homa Brook flows down from the world heritage site of
              Sinharaja forest and proceeds by the edge of the Kothalawala
              Bungalow down the ravine and cascades down a rocky cliff from
              where it breaks into a lovely gush. The splendid view of Sri Pada
              to the north of the tea factory and the clear beaches to the south
              of the factory are very rare scenic sights one could ever think of
              viewing from a single point. The estate commenced operations in
              1920
